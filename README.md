# Reports
This repository contains the reports written on each assignment. The reports include detailed theoretical background of the techniques used in each assignemtnt, the algorithmic process, and the results obtained from implementing those techniques.

Small summary of the main details of the reports: 
- Assignment 1: Background-Foreground separation of videos using the DMD.
- Assignment 2: Tracking the positions of a spring-mass system and applying the SINDy method to learn the equations of motion that govern the dynamics of this system. 
- Assignment 3: Training a neural network that takes the solutions (the state variables) to the next and functions for three different parameter values.
